    <p>Pork chops are the most popular cut of pork. They come from the loin which is the meat that runs from the pig’s hip to its shoulder.</p>

    <p>While there are a variety of names for pork chops like loin, rib, sirloin, top loin, and blade chops, it’s important to remember that they all cook the same.</p>
        
    <p>The length of cooking primarily depends on the thickness of the chop. Some prefer thin cut chops, but others prefer the juiciness of a thick-cut chop on the bone. Thickness can vary from ½ to 2 inches.</p>
